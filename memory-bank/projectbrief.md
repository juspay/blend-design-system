# Project Brief: Storybook Implementation for Blend Design System

## Project Overview

Implement comprehensive Storybook stories for all components in the Blend Design System, following the established pattern used for the Button component.

## Goals

1. Create consistent, comprehensive Storybook stories for all 34+ components
2. Ensure each story follows the established pattern with proper controls, examples, and documentation
3. Leverage existing component documentation from the docs site to extract prop information and usage examples
4. Maintain consistency with the existing Button.stories.tsx pattern

## Scope

- **Target**: All components listed in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/meta.json`
- **Pattern**: Follow the structure established in `Button.stories.tsx`
- **Documentation**: Extract information from corresponding `.mdx` files in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/`
- **Location**: Stories will be created in `apps/storybook/stories/components/`

## Components List (34 Total)

Accordion, Alert, Avatar, AvatarGroup, Breadcrumb, Button (✓ done), ButtonGroup, ButtonGroupV2, ButtonV2, Charts, Checkbox, DataTable, DateRangePicker, Directory, Dropdown, GradientBlur, Inputs, Menu, Modal, MultiSelect, Popover, Primitives, Radio, Select, Sidebar, SingleSelect, Snackbar, SplitTag, StatCard, Switch, Tabs, Tags, Text, Tooltip

## Current Status

- ✅ Button component story is complete and serves as the pattern template
- ❌ 33 other components need stories implementation
- ✅ Storybook configuration is complete and functional
- ✅ Component documentation exists in MDX format for reference

## Success Criteria

1. All 34 components have functional Storybook stories
2. Each story includes Default, Playground, and relevant variant examples
3. Stories follow consistent naming and structure
4. All component props are properly exposed in Storybook controls
5. Stories include comprehensive documentation and usage examples

## Technical Context

- **Framework**: React + TypeScript + Storybook 7
- **Design System**: Blend-v1 component library
- **Monorepo**: Using pnpm workspace structure
- **Story Location**: `apps/storybook/stories/components/*.stories.tsx`
