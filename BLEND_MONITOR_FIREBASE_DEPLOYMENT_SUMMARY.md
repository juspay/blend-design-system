# Blend Monitor Firebase Deployment - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Cloud Functions Setup

- Created `apps/blend-monitor/functions/` directory with TypeScript configuration
- Implemented Express-based API structure with proper middleware
- Migrated all API routes to Cloud Functions:
    - ‚úÖ `/api/users/:userId/role` - User role management
    - ‚úÖ `/api/deployments/history` - Deployment history (GET/POST)
    - ‚úÖ `/api/deployments/usage` - Firebase usage metrics
    - ‚úÖ `/api/deployments/performance` - Performance metrics
    - ‚úÖ `/api/deployments/rollback` - Rollback functionality
    - ‚úÖ `/api/deployments/hosting/status` - Hosting deployment status
    - ‚úÖ `/api/npm` - NPM package statistics

### 2. Firebase Configuration

- Updated `firebase.json` with:
    - Blend Monitor hosting configuration
    - Cloud Functions configuration
    - API route rewrites (`/api/*` ‚Üí Cloud Functions)
    - Proper caching headers
    - Database rules configuration

### 3. Next.js Configuration

- Configured for static export:
    - `output: 'export'`
    - `distDir: 'out'`
    - Unoptimized images for static export
- Added development proxy for local API testing
- Configured webpack to handle server-only modules

### 4. Deployment Automation

- Created deployment script: `apps/blend-monitor/scripts/deploy.sh`
- Supports staging and production deployments
- Includes safety checks for production deployments

### 5. Documentation

- Created comprehensive deployment guide: `apps/blend-monitor/FIREBASE_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Created detailed deployment plan: `BLEND_MONITOR_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`

## üöÄ Ready to Deploy!

### Quick Start Deployment

1. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd apps/blend-monitor/functions
    npm install
    ```

2. **Deploy to Firebase:**
    ```bash
    cd apps/blend-monitor
    ./scripts/deploy.sh
    ```

### What Happens During Deployment

1. **Build Phase:**
    - Next.js app is built as static export ‚Üí `out/` directory
    - Cloud Functions are compiled from TypeScript ‚Üí `functions/lib/`

2. **Deploy Phase:**
    - Static files uploaded to Firebase Hosting
    - Cloud Functions deployed to handle API requests
    - Database rules updated

3. **Result:**
    - App available at: https://blend-monitor.web.app
    - API endpoints: https://blend-monitor.web.app/api/*
    - All API calls automatically routed to Cloud Functions

## üìù Important Notes

### API Architecture

- All API routes now run as Cloud Functions
- Authentication handled via Firebase Auth tokens
- CORS configured for cross-origin requests
- Express.js handles routing within the Cloud Function

### Frontend Changes

- No changes needed to frontend code!
- API calls using relative URLs (`/api/*`) work automatically
- Firebase SDK calls continue to work as before

### Local Development

1. Start Firebase emulators:

    ```bash
    cd apps/blend-monitor/functions
    npm run serve
    ```

2. Start Next.js dev server:
    ```bash
    cd apps/blend-monitor
    npm run dev
    ```

### Environment Variables

Set these in Firebase Functions config:

```bash
firebase functions:config:set \
  firebase.database_url="https://storybook-452807.firebaseio.com" \
  firebase.project_id="storybook-452807" \
  --project storybook-452807
```

## üéâ Migration Complete!

The Blend Monitor app is now fully configured for Firebase Hosting deployment with Cloud Functions handling all API routes. The app maintains all its functionality while gaining the benefits of serverless deployment.
