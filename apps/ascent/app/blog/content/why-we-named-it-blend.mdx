Modern products rarely live in isolation. They exist inside ecosystems—legacy systems, partner tools, internal dashboards, consumer surfaces—each with its own gravity. A design system that insists on a singular aesthetic or loud identity often creates friction. It demands attention where attention isn't the goal. Blend was named to reject that impulse.

To blend is not to disappear. It is to harmonize. Blend is built on the belief that great systems should adapt to their surroundings, not overwrite them. It absorbs existing patterns, respects local conventions, and aligns with the mental models users already carry. Instead of forcing uniformity, it creates coherence.

## Command to install blend UI

```bash
npm i @juspay/blend-design-system
```

Blend UI didn't start in a boardroom. It came together through messy whiteboards, sticky notes everywhere, quick ideas, and a lot of changing our minds mid-way.

We didn't begin with features. We looked at how people actually use products. Jumping between screens, tasks, and dashboards without thinking too much about it.

Small decisions sit behind every screen. You'll probably never notice. That's the point.
