# Active Context: Storybook Implementation

## Current Focus

Working on both Phase 4 complex components and Phase 5 specialized components. Just completed DataTable component with comprehensive features and examples.

## Immediate Tasks

1. âœ… **Phase 1**: Plan the implementation approach and create task breakdown
2. âœ… **Phase 2**: Implement stories for high-priority components (Alert, Avatar, Checkbox, etc.)
3. âœ… **Phase 3**: Implement stories for form components (Inputs, Select, Radio, Switch, Button variants)
4. ðŸš§ **Phase 4**: Implement stories for complex components (Modal, DataTable, Charts, etc.)
5. ðŸš§ **Phase 5**: Implement stories for specialized components (Tags, SplitTag, AvatarGroup, etc.)

## Current Decisions

- **Pattern**: Use established story patterns with comprehensive examples
- **Structure**: Each story includes Default, variants, examples, and comprehensive showcases
- **Documentation**: Extract props and examples from existing MDX documentation
- **Approach**: Systematic implementation in phases based on component complexity
- **Organization**: Related components grouped in shared folders (e.g., Button folder, Tags folder)
- **Animations**: Disabled chart animations in Storybook to prevent distracting effects
- **Button Props**: Use `text` and `leadingIcon` props for Button component (not `children` or `leftIcon`)
- **Type Safety**: Use Record<string, unknown> for DataTable type constraints

## Recent Accomplishments

1. âœ… **DataTable Component Complete**: Implemented comprehensive DataTable story with all column types, sorting, filtering, pagination, search, inline editing, row expansion, server-side operations, and real-world examples
2. âœ… **Type Safety Fixed**: Resolved TypeScript issues with proper type constraints and Button component props
3. âœ… **Column Types**: Demonstrated all column types including Text, Number, Date, Avatar, Tag, Select, MultiSelect, and Custom
4. âœ… **Progress Update**: 23 of 34 components completed (68%), working on both Phase 4 & 5 simultaneously

## Next Steps

1. Continue with remaining Phase 4 complex components
2. Continue with remaining Phase 5 specialized components
3. Focus on Menu, Dropdown, Sidebar, Directory (Phase 4)
4. Focus on AvatarGroup, StatCard, GradientBlur (Phase 5)

## Resources Available

- âœ… Existing Button.stories.tsx pattern
- âœ… Component MDX documentation in `apps/docs/content/docs/components/`
- âœ… Component meta information and prop tables
- âœ… Working Storybook configuration
- âœ… Component exports available in `blend-v1` package
- âœ… Charts story as reference for complex data visualization components
- âœ… Tags folder as reference for organizing related components
- âœ… Snackbar implementation as reference for toast notifications
- âœ… DataTable implementation as reference for complex table components

## Constraints

- Must maintain consistency with existing Button story pattern
- Must extract accurate prop information from documentation
- Must ensure all stories are functional and properly tested
- Must follow TypeScript best practices and proper imports
- Must consider performance implications (e.g., disabling animations where appropriate)
- Must organize related components in shared folders for better maintainability
- Must use correct Button props (`text`, `leadingIcon`) not legacy props
- Must handle type constraints properly (e.g., Record<string, unknown> for DataTable)

## Technical Notes

- **DataTable Implementation**: Complex component with multiple features - sorting, filtering, pagination, inline editing, row expansion
- **Column Types**: Supports Text, Number, Date, Avatar, Tag, Select, MultiSelect, and Custom column types
- **Type Constraints**: DataTable requires Record<string, unknown> type constraint for proper TypeScript compatibility
- **Button Integration**: All Button components use ButtonType/ButtonSize enums (not ButtonTypeV2/ButtonSizeV2)
- **AvatarData**: Requires 'id' property in addition to label, sublabel, imageUrl, and initials
- **Server-Side Operations**: Demonstrated with simulated API calls for pagination, sorting, and search
- **Progress Tracking**: Now at 68% completion with 23 components done, 9 remaining
- **Phase Status**: Both Phase 4 and Phase 5 are in progress simultaneously
