# 🚀 Release Workflow Guide

This document explains the improved release workflow for the Blend Design System NPM package. The workflow supports **incremental beta versioning** (`X.Y.Z-beta.0`, `X.Y.Z-beta.1`, etc.) to allow multiple testing iterations before promoting to stable.

## 📋 Overview

### Workflow Structure

1. **Create Beta Release** (`create-beta-release.yml`) - Creates beta releases from `staging` branch with incremental versioning
2. **Publish Beta to NPM** (`publish-beta-npm.yml`) - Publishes beta versions to NPM
3. **Promote Beta to Stable** (`promote-to-stable.yml`) - Promotes tested beta to stable release
4. **Publish Stable to NPM** (`publish-stable-npm.yml`) - Publishes stable versions to NPM

### Key Features

- ✅ **Incremental Beta Versioning** - Multiple beta iterations (`beta.0`, `beta.1`, `beta.2`, etc.)
- ✅ **Enhanced Changelog Generation** - Categorized, descriptive changelogs with conventional commits
- ✅ **Proper Branch Strategy** - Clear separation between dev, staging, and main branches
- ✅ **Version Management** - Automatic beta/stable version handling
- ✅ **NPM Publishing** - Separate workflows for beta and stable publishing
- ✅ **Validation & Safety** - Multiple checks to prevent publishing errors
- ✅ **Detailed Release Notes** - Rich GitHub releases with installation instructions

## 🔢 Beta Versioning System

### Version Format

```
X.Y.Z-beta.N

Where:
- X.Y.Z = Base semantic version (e.g., 1.2.3)
- N = Beta iteration number (0, 1, 2, ...)

Examples:
- 1.0.0-beta.0  → First beta for version 1.0.0
- 1.0.0-beta.1  → Second beta (after fixing issues)
- 1.0.0-beta.2  → Third beta (more fixes)
- 1.0.0         → Stable release (promoted from beta.2)
```

### Why Multiple Beta Sub-Versions?

The beta sub-version system (`beta.0`, `beta.1`, `beta.2`, etc.) allows you to:

1. **Iterative Testing**: Test each beta version thoroughly before promoting to stable
2. **Issue Resolution**: Fix issues found in `beta.0` and release `beta.1`, then test again
3. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure each beta iteration is properly tested before moving forward
4. **Confidence**: Only promote to stable when you're confident the version works correctly

**Key Principle**: Each beta sub-version (`beta.N`) should be tested and verified before creating the next one (`beta.N+1`) or promoting to stable.

## 🔄 Release Process

### Beta Release Process (Iterative)

#### First Beta (`X.Y.Z-beta.0`)

1. **Trigger**: From `staging` branch
2. **Workflow**: `Create Beta Release`
3. **Settings**:
    - Version bump type: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`
    - Increment existing beta: `false` (creates new version)
4. **Result**: Creates `X.Y.Z-beta.0`

#### Subsequent Betas (`X.Y.Z-beta.1`, `beta.2`, etc.)

1. **Trigger**: From `staging` branch (after fixing issues)
2. **Workflow**: `Create Beta Release`
3. **Settings**:
    - Increment existing beta: `true` (increments beta number)
4. **Result**: Creates `X.Y.Z-beta.N+1`

### Stable Release Process

1. **Trigger**: From `staging` branch (after beta testing is complete)
2. **Workflow**: `Promote Beta to Stable`
3. **Action**: Converts `X.Y.Z-beta.N` to `X.Y.Z`, creates GitHub release
4. **Next**: Merge PR to `main`, then trigger `Publish Stable to NPM`

## 📁 Branch Strategy

```
main (stable releases)
   ↑
   └── PR from staging (after promote-to-stable workflow)

staging (beta releases)
   ↑                    ↑
   └── PR from dev      └── Auto PR from staging (create-beta-release)
   (manual, after       (auto-created, then manual PR dev → staging)
    auto PR merged)

dev (development)
   ↑
   └── Feature branches merge here
```

### Branch Purposes

- **`dev`**: Active development, feature branches merge here
- **`staging`**: Beta releases, testing before production
- **`main`**: Stable releases, production-ready code

### Branch Flow Details

**Beta Release Flow:**

1. Workflow runs on `staging` → creates PR: `staging` → `dev` (auto)
2. Merge PR to `dev` → manually create PR: `dev` → `staging`
3. Merge PR to `staging` → publish beta to NPM from `staging`

**Stable Release Flow:**

1. Workflow runs on `staging` → creates PR: `staging` → `main` (auto)
2. Merge PR to `main` → publish stable to NPM from `main`

**Why this flow?**

- Ensures `dev` always has the latest version information
- Keeps `staging` in sync with version changes
- Maintains clear separation: beta on `staging`, stable on `main`

## 🛠 How to Use

### Creating First Beta Release

1. **Ensure your code is in `staging` branch**

    ```bash
    git checkout staging
    git pull origin staging
    ```

2. **Trigger the workflow**
    - Go to Actions → "Create Beta Release"
    - Click "Run workflow"
    - Select version bump type: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`
    - **Set "Increment existing beta version" to `false`** (creates new version)
    - Click "Run workflow"

3. **Merge PR to `dev` branch** (Step 1 of 2)
    - The workflow auto-creates a PR: `staging` → `dev`
    - Review changelog and version changes
    - **Merge the PR to `dev` branch**

4. **Create and merge PR from `dev` → `staging`** (Step 2 of 2)
    - **Manually create a PR** from `dev` → `staging`
    - This syncs the version back to `staging` branch
    - **Merge the PR to `staging` branch**
    - ⚠️ **Important**: This step is required before publishing to NPM

5. **Publish to NPM**
    - Go to Actions → "Publish Beta to NPM"
    - From `staging` branch, type "PUBLISH" to confirm
    - Click "Run workflow"

6. **Install and test**
    ```bash
    npm install @juspay/blend-design-system@beta
    # or specific version
    npm install @juspay/blend-design-system@1.0.0-beta.0
    ```

### Creating Subsequent Beta Releases (After Finding Issues)

1. **Fix issues in `dev` branch**
    - Make fixes in `dev` branch
    - Commit and push changes

2. **Merge fixes to `staging`**
    - Create PR: `dev` → `staging`
    - Merge the PR to `staging`

3. **Trigger the workflow**
    - Go to Actions → "Create Beta Release"
    - Click "Run workflow"
    - **Set "Increment existing beta version" to `true`** (Important!)
    - Click "Run workflow"
    - **Result**: `1.0.0-beta.0` → `1.0.0-beta.1` (or `beta.N` → `beta.N+1`)

4. **Merge PR to `dev` branch** (Step 1 of 2)
    - The workflow auto-creates a PR: `staging` → `dev`
    - **Merge the PR to `dev` branch**

5. **Create and merge PR from `dev` → `staging`** (Step 2 of 2)
    - **Manually create a PR** from `dev` → `staging`
    - **Merge the PR to `staging` branch**

6. **Publish and test again**
    - Run "Publish Beta to NPM" workflow from `staging`
    - Test the new beta version
    - Repeat steps 1-6 until no issues are found

### Promoting Beta to Stable Release

1. **Ensure beta testing is complete on `staging` branch**
    - All beta iterations have been tested (e.g., `beta.0`, `beta.1`, `beta.2`)
    - No issues found in the latest beta version
    - Ready for production release

    ```bash
    git checkout staging
    git pull origin staging
    ```

2. **Trigger the workflow**
    - Go to Actions → "Promote Beta to Stable"
    - Click "Run workflow"
    - Type "PROMOTE" to confirm
    - Click "Run workflow"
    - **Result**: `1.0.0-beta.2` → `1.0.0` (removes beta suffix)

3. **Review and merge PR to `main` branch**
    - The workflow auto-creates a PR: `staging` → `main`
    - Review changelog and version changes
    - **Merge the PR to `main` branch**

4. **Publish to NPM**
    - Go to Actions → "Publish Stable to NPM"
    - From `main` branch, type "PUBLISH" to confirm
    - Click "Run workflow"
    - This publishes with `latest` tag on NPM

## 📊 Workflow Decision Tree

```
Do you have issues to fix in beta?
│
├── YES → Run "Create Beta Release" with increment_beta=true
│         Result: beta.N → beta.N+1
│
└── NO → Ready for stable?
         │
         ├── YES → Run "Promote Beta to Stable"
         │         Result: X.Y.Z-beta.N → X.Y.Z
         │
         └── NO → Continue testing current beta
```

## 🔒 Safety Features

### Version Validation

- Validates version format before processing
- Supports both old format (`X.Y.Z-beta`) and new format (`X.Y.Z-beta.N`)
- Prevents publishing non-beta versions as beta
- Prevents publishing beta versions as stable
- Checks for existing versions on NPM

### Branch Protection

- Beta workflows only run from `staging` branch
- Stable workflows only run from `main` branch
- Promote workflow runs from `staging` and creates PR to `main`
- Requires manual confirmation for publishing

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error messages
- Rollback capabilities for failed operations
- Detailed logging for debugging

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Development

1. **Use Conventional Commits**: Ensures good changelog generation
2. **Test Each Beta**: Install and test each beta iteration before proceeding
3. **Review PRs Carefully**: Auto-generated PRs contain important changes
4. **Follow Branch Strategy**: Keep dev, staging, and main in sync

### For Beta Testing

1. **Start with beta.0**: First beta of a new version
2. **Increment on Issues**: Use `increment_beta=true` when fixing issues
3. **Document Issues**: Keep track of what was fixed in each beta
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Each beta should be tested before the next

### For Stable Releases

1. **Only Promote Tested Betas**: Ensure all known issues are fixed
2. **Review Beta History**: Check how many iterations were needed
3. **Update Documentation**: Ensure docs match the released version
4. **Communicate Changes**: Share release notes with team and users

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Version already exists on NPM"

- **Cause**: Trying to publish a version that already exists
- **Solution**: Run `Create Beta Release` with `increment_beta=true` to create next beta

#### "Not a beta version" error

- **Cause**: Running beta workflow on stable version
- **Solution**: Run `Create Beta Release` with `increment_beta=false` to create new beta

#### "NPM authentication failed"

- **Cause**: Invalid or missing NPM token
- **Solution**: Check NPM_TOKEN secret in repository settings

### Debug Steps

1. **Check workflow logs**: Review the GitHub Actions logs for detailed errors
2. **Verify branch**: Ensure you're on the correct branch for the workflow
3. **Check version**: Verify the package.json version is as expected
4. **Test locally**: Run the changelog script locally to test
